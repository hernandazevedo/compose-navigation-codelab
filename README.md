## [1\. Introduction](#0)

**Last Updated:** 2021-03-17

## **What you'll need**

*   [Android Studio Bumblebee](https://developer.android.com/studio)
*   Knowledge of Kotlin
*   Basic understanding of Compose (such as the `@Composable` annotation)
*   Consider taking the [Jetpack Compose basics codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-basics/) before this codelab

## **Navigating with Compose**

[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) is a Jetpack library that enables navigating from one destination within your app to another, along specific routes. The Navigation library also provides a specific artifact to enable consistent and idiomatic navigation within screens built with Jetpack Compose. This artifact (`navigation-compose`) is the focal point of this codelab.

## **What you'll do**

You're going to use the [Rally Material study](https://material.io/design/material-studies/rally.html#about-rally) as the base for this codelab. You'll migrate the existing navigation code to use the Jetpack Navigation component to navigate between screens in Jetpack Compose.

## **What you'll learn**

*   Basics of using Jetpack Navigation with Jetpack Compose
*   Navigating between composables
*   Navigating with required and optional arguments
*   Navigating using deep links
*   Integrating a TabBar into your navigation hierarchy
*   Testing navigation
